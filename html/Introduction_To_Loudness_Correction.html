Human hearing    works in a very different manner. Frequency components and their durations    affect how loud a sound feels. This means loudness can not be measured with    a peak meter. To accurately measure loudness we need an algorithm that    mimics the way humans perceive loudness.<br>    <br>    When we talk about loudness in this document we mean loudness as it is    perceived by a person or&nbsp; a measurement done with a loudness meter.    When we talk about peak value or peak level we mean the electrical    measurement of the highest electrical peak of a sound signal.<br>    <br>    <br>    <h2><a id="Loudness jumps">Loudness jumps<br>      </a></h2>    Loudness jumps have been a problem since the start of tv and radio. Proper    tools to measure and control loudness have not been available until very    recently. This is why the problem has remained unsolved until our days.<br>    <br>    There are two separate problems that needs to be solved:<br>    <ol>      <li>Loudness jumps inside a program.</li>      <li>Loudness jumps between programs.<br>      </li>    </ol>    <br>    <br>    <h2><a id="Why haven't we been able to solve the loudness problem ?">Why        haven't we been able to solve the loudness problem ?</a></h2>    The lack of a working model of human perception of loudness has prevented    the creation of proper tools to measure and manage loudness. A peak meter    has been our only 'loudness' tool even thought the reading does not    correspond to human hearing in any way.<br>    <br>    Loudness problem has not always been this bad. In the analog era we used PPM    - meters that had some deliberate 'slowness' on the reaction to rapid    changes in sound level. This slowness had an averaging effect that removed    fast peaks causing the meter reading to correspond more to human hearing and    perception of loudness. Fast digital meters has surpassed PPM meters now and    we have lost the averaging effect of the PPM meter. Fast digital meters do    not correspond any more to the way how humans perceive loudness .<br>    <br>    The 1990's gave birth to new digital tools that allowed sound processing on    a level that was not possible before. A new phenomenon "hyper-compression"    emerged in the music industry. The method used agressive compression to make    music sound louder on car radio. It was used as a competetive tool to make a    companys music stand out from the competition. Hyper-compression squeezes    sound to the edge of distortion lowering sound quality in the process. Hyper    compressed sound also causes listening fatigue. This trend soon crossed over    to radio and television.<br>    <br>    Compressing a sound can cause the electrical peaks to go down while    simultaneously loudness of audio goes up. A peak meter is not useful when    metering hyper-compressed sound because the peaks don't correspond to the    loudness of audio in any way.<br>    <br>    The lack of proper loudness meter left the sound engineer to use the only    loudness sensitive device he has, his ears. Measuring loudness using ones    ears works surprisingly well. A sound engineer can easily produce material    with consistent loudness in the course of a day, but this method has a    fundamental problem. Since there is no commonly agreed standard for the    loudness target level there is no way for a sound engineer to produce    material with the same loudness level as another.<br>    <br>    <br>    <h2><a id="Peak level and loudness">Peak level and loudness</a></h2>    <br>    <strong>DemoVideo 1:</strong> The video below demostrates what happens when    audio is levelled using only the peak level.

The picture below shows loudness (lower part) and peak    levels (upper part) of a heavy-metal concert. <br>    <br>    Electrical peaks on the upper part are high during interviews and low during    musical performances.<br>    <br>    The levels on the upper and lower parts of the picture are in total    disagreement with each other. When electrical peaks go high the measured    loudness goes down. What has happened here is that musical performances have    been heavily compressed while much less compression is used on the    interviews. Compression has increased music loudness while simultaneously    lowering it's electrical peaks.<br>    <br>    If we measured this material simultaneously with a digital peak meter and a    loudness meter, they would show opposing values. When peak levels go up    loudness goes down.<br>    <br>    What this all means is that a peak meter is quite useless in determining    audio loudness.<br>    <br>    <br>    <img src="Pictures/Sample_Peaks_vs_Loudness-English.jpg"><br>    <br>    <br>    <h2><a id="EBU R128 loudness recommendation">EBU R128 loudness        recommendation</a></h2>    <h2></h2>    <p>The European Broadcasting Union EBU published loudness recommendation <strong>R128</strong>      in august 2010.

The result of    integrated loudness can be seen on the right side of the meter display and    the led bar shows results from momentary loudness measuremets. Note how the    result from integrated loudness moves very slowly compared to the fast led    bar.<br>    <br>    The slow response to loudness variations of the integrated measuremets is    caused by the fact that integrated loudness is the averaged sum of previous    loudness measurements. Short changes in the loudness have no effect on    integrated loudness, a large number of changes toward the same direction are    needed before the averaged result starts to move into that direction. This    means that it is possible that there are large loudness variations inside a    file and the integrated loudnes still hits the target level of -23 LUFS. The    user still has the responsibility to adjust loudness variations in a program    to fit the distribution channel.<br>    <br>    If your browser is not able to play the video below, then you can watch it    on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IF8j8IEtOc&amp;vq&amp;hd=1">YouTube</a>.<br>    <br>    <br>    <video controls="controls" height="576" width="768"> <source src="../video/webm/DemoVideo-4.webm"        type="video/webm">      <source src="../video/mp4/DemoVideo-4.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser      does not support the video tag. </video> <br>    <br>    <br>    <h2><a id="Realtime or file based loudness measurement ?">Realtime or file        based loudness measurement</a> ?<br>    </h2>    Loudness measurement can be done in two different ways: realtime and file    based measurement. Both methods have different target applications.<br>    <br>    <h3>Realtime loudness measurement<br>    </h3>    Realtime loudness measurement can be used in places where the user has the    possibility to read the loudness meter in realtime and also adjust volume of    the sound sources in realtime. This method of loudness metering is best in    production environments where the program is recorded live like tv -    studios, OB vans, live radio, broadcasting centers, etc.<br>    <br>    A realtime meter is not absolutely necessary, but can be useful to a sound    engineer in a post production studio. Mixing is traditionally done using    ones ears as the loudness meter and this still works very well.<br>    <br>    <h3>File based loudness measurement<br>    </h3>    If a program is stored as a file before transmission, then the loudness    measurement can be done on the audio file of the program. The file can also    be automatically corrected to the target loudness level after doing the    loudness measurement.<br>    <br>    <h3>Both measurement methods</h3>    The best loudness meter is still the human ear.&nbsp; A machine has no sense    of what sound is important (for example speech) and what is not (for example    the sound of heavy rain). The user is still responsible for adjusting    loudness variations inside a program to fit the transmission channel. A    loudness meter provides a common 'anchor' for the loudness level of all    program material.<br>    <br>    Viewer adjusts the volume of their tv -sets based on the loudness of speech.    If speech level changes then the viewer must adjust his listening volume    again. It is important that speech loudness is at the EBU target level or at    least very close to it.<br>    <br>    <br>    <h2><a id="Loudness jumps in tv transmission">Loudness jumps in tv        transmission<br>      </a></h2>    The picture below displays loudness variations in the transmission stream of    a tv station in the spring of 2012. There is a timeline on the bottom of the    picture, the measurement took place from 10 o'clock am to 3 o'clock pm.    Loudness is measured in 3 second time slices and the measurements are shown    in red in the picture. EBU loudness scale (LUFS) is on the left side of the    picture. EBU target level -23 LUFS is shown as the green line the goes    across the picture. Loudness leve of individual programs are shown as black    lines. The little black dots are trailers shown between programs.<br>    <br>    Eight programs were transmitted during the measurement period and the    loudness of these varies greatly on both sides of the EBU target loudness    level. This picture tells the story of a typical day in tv broadcasting.<br>    <br>    The loudness variations in the transmission stream are the result of trying    to handle loudness using only a peak meter. Clearly a peak meter is almost    useless in loudness management and we need better tools to handle the    situation.<br>    <br>    <br>    <img alt="" src="Pictures/The_Problem.png"><br>    <br>    <br>    The picture below shows a couple of problem spots in the transmission. At 11    o'clock loudness drops 7 LUs, at 12:05 loudness increases 7.8 LUs and at    12:50 it drops by 6.8 LUs. Loudness jumps this big are annoying and the    viewer is likely to grab his remote control to adjust the volume.<br>    <br>    <br>    <img src="Pictures/The_Problem-2-english.jpg"><br>    <br>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <h2><a id="Automatic file based loudness correction">Automatic file based        loudness correction</a></h2>    In the capters below I will describe the usage of the free file based    automatic loudness correction and measurement tool FreeLCS (<a href="http://freelcs.sourceforge.net">http://freelcs.sourceforge.net</a>).

In the example digital samples are taken exactly when the analog    voltage is at its highest peak. The sample rate coincides with the peaks in    the signal and the peak values are recorded correctly into the digital data.<br>    <br>    <br>    <img alt="" src="Pictures/TruePeak-Sampling-1.png"><br>    <br>    Sometimes there can be very fast peaks in the audio that happen before or    after samples are taken. Instead of the true values of the peaks in the    signal lower values are recorded in the digital data.<br>    <br>    The problem may go undetected until audio is converted back to analog or the    audio is compressed in a lossy format (mpeg2, mpeg3, aac) for transmission.    Then these 'phantom peaks' can appear back in the signal.<br>    <br>    A conventional digital peak meter won't show these phantom peaks because the    information is not available in digital samples of the audio. When samples    are converted back to analog audio then these phantom peaks can go over the    maximum allowed level in the DA - converter and introduce distortion to the    sound.<br>    <br>    <br>    <img alt="" src="Pictures/TruePeak-Sampling-2.png"><br>    <br>    ITU recommends a method called "TruePeak" to find these phantom peaks after    the signal is already in digital format.&nbsp; This method calculates new    samples between samples taken when digitizing audio and this makes the    phantom peaks visible again.<br>    <br>    A meter that shows peak using this method uses ascale called dBTP when a    conventional sample peak meter uses dBFS.<br>    <br>    In practice I have seen phantom peaks 3 dBs higher than the highest sample    peak value in the same audio. It is possible for a TruePeak measurement to    show values that go over the maximum allowed peak of the dBFS scale (0 dBFS)    showing positive TruePeak values for example +3 dBTP. In this case this    would mean that the true peak value is 3 dBs over the maximum value of for    example a DA - converter and converting a signal like this back to analog    would cause distortion in the DA - converter.<br>    <br>    EBU R128 recommends always using TruePeak when measuring audio peaks. The    maximum allowed value for peaks in R128 is &nbsp; -1 dBTP (dBs using the    TruePeak scale).<br>    <br>    In the picture below new samples has been calculated between samples taken    during audio digitization. These new samples make the phantom peaks visible    again.<br>    <br>    <br>    <img alt="" src="Pictures/TruePeak-Sampling-3.png"><br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <h2><a id="Important things to know about loudness correction">Important        things to know about loudness correction</a></h2>    There are a couple of important things to take into consideration when using    loudness correction.<br>    <h3>Audio channels</h3>    All audio channels of one mix must be in the same file. If you split a    stereo mix to left and right files and process both separately then the    loudness level of the corrected files will be wrong by 3 LUs.<br>    <br>    One file can only have one mix in it.<strong> Example:</strong> If a program    consists of three different mixes: stereo English,&nbsp;&nbsp; stereo    French, &nbsp; 5.1 English, then the mixes must be processed as follows:<br>    <br>    <strong>File 1</strong> = Stereo English<br>    <strong>File 2</strong> = Stereo French<br>    <strong>File 3</strong> = 5.1 English<br>    <br>    <h3>Processing raw material<br>    </h3>    EBU R128 is meant for processing only finished programs that are ready for    transmission. It is not possible to loudness correct uncut raw material,    because the integrated loudness of a file changes when parts of it are cut    away. Integrated loudness measurement consists of the averaged sum of    multiple short loudness measurement results. The sum of these measuremets    changes when a portion of results are throuwn away (patrs of a file is cut    away). As a rule of thumb only process finished audio mixes of programs that    won't be changed any more.<br>    <br>    There is an exeption to the rule. Some types of programs can benefit from    processing parts of if independently from each other. An example is a    program that consists of a studio host presenting the next animation and a    bunch of animations produced outside your company. The different parts of    the program can have very different loudness levels and if put together    without correction could produce large loudness jumps inside the program.    You can get rid of the loudness differences between each part by processing    them separately. If you do this be careful not to include any parts that are    giong to be cut away. Silence won't affect integrated loudness since    loudness levels below -70 dB are not taken into account in loudness    measurement. So you can cut away silent parts without affecting integrated    loudness of a file.<br>    <br>    <h3>Loudness variations in a program</h3>    Loudness correction is a tool that adjusts loudness level of a program to    match other programs in the transmission stream. Loudness correction won't    change loudness variations in a file in any way. If the material is too    dynamic before correction it will be too dynamic after the correction also.    The user has the responsibility to adjust loudness variations in a file to    fit the transmission channel. This means that loudness variations must be    restricted to a range that is usable in the average home listening    environment.<br>    <br>    <h3>The average loudness will go down</h3>    A typical European tv station has a averaged loudness somewhere between -21    and -20 LUFS. The EBU R128 therefore causes the average loudness to go down    by 2 - 3 LUs.<br>    <br>    <h3>R128 brings good things with it<br>    </h3>    When audio levelling is done using loudness of audio, there will be more    electrical headroom for peaks to exist. Heavy compression gives no loudness    advantage any more, it only makes the mix sound bad. This will probably    encourage sound engineers to make their mixes more airy and pleasing to the    ear.<br>    <br>    EBU R128 moves responsibility for the listening level back to where it    always was supposed to be, to the viewer. When loudness of all programs is    at the same level then the viewer is at last allowed to decide the listening    level of his won living room.<br>    <ul>    </ul>    <strong>DemoVideo 3:</strong> Audio samples from DemoVideo 1 are now all    corrected to the EBU target loudness level (-23 LUFS).<br>    <br>    &nbsp;If your browser is not able to play the video below, then you can    watch it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I64kckkp3BE&amp;vq&amp;hd=1">YouTube</a>.<br>    <br>    <br>    <video controls="controls" height="576" width="768"> <source src="../video/webm/DemoVideo-3.webm"        type="video/webm">      <source src="../video/mp4/DemoVideo-3.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser      does not support the video tag. </video> <br>    <br>    <br>    <h2><a id="How does the EBU R128 affect sound engineers work ?">How does the        EBU R128 affect sound engineers work ?</a></h2>    The biggest practical change that R128 causes is that heavy compression    gives no loudness advantage any more, it only makes the mix to sound bad.<br>    <br>    The average listening volume used by viewers is quite low and this limits    the usable dynamics range available for the mixing sound engineer. The    average listening volume used in homes won't be affected by the fact that    the broadcaster starts to use R128 loudness management. The usable    dynamics&nbsp; range therefore stays the same as it was before R128.<br>    <br>    The maximum allowed level for peaks is -1 dBTP in the EBU loudness    recommendation. All peak values below that are ok. This means that the peak    value is no longer important. It does not matter what the peak value is as    long as it won't go over the maximum allowed -1 dBTP.<br>    <br>    Old methods of making a mix sound good are still valid after R128. The only    change is that the loudness of the mix is forced to the same loudness level    with every other program.<br>    <br>    The best loudness meter is still the human ear. A machine has no way of    knowing what sound is important and what is not (for example speech versus    the sound of rain).<br>    <br>    <h2><a id="Mounting the server HotFolder">Mounting the server HotFolder to        the workstation<br>      </a></h2>    The links below lead to instructions on how to mount the server disk to a    local workstation on different operating systems.<br>    <br>    <a href="Mounting_the_server_hotfolder/Mounting_server_HotFolder_on_windows_7.html">Mounting

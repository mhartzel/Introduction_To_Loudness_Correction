    <br>
    The next window offers a free drive letter to assign permanently to the
    drive. In our example windows offers the letter Z:<br>
    <br>
    Fill in the address of the server as shown on the picture. The address must
    start with two backslashes and have the network share name
    "\LoudnessCorrection" at the end of it.<br>
    <br>
    Make sure to tick option "<strong>Reconnect at logon</strong>". When this
    option is ticked you don't have to do anything to mount the server disk next
    time you boot, since windows will do it automatically for you.<br>
    <br>
    Click "<strong>Finnish</strong>".<br>
    <br>
    Note: the ip - address shown on the picture is just for demonstration, get
    the real address for your server from your it - staff.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Now windows mounts the disk and shows its contents on a window.<br>

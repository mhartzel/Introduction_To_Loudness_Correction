    <h1>Mounting the server HotFolder on a OS X workstation<br>
    </h1>
    <br>
    First click an empty spot on your desktop, this activates the Finder -
    program.<br>
    <br>
    The keyboard shortcut to bring up the "<strong>Connect to Server</strong>" -
    window is <strong>cmd + k</strong>, so keep <strong>cmd</strong> pressed
    and press <strong>k</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    Write "<strong>smb://your servers ip address</strong>" in the prompt and
    press "<strong>Connect</strong>".<br>
    <br>
    Note: the ip - address shown on the picture is just for demonstration, get
    the real address for your server from your it - staff.<br>
    <br>

    The next window lets you choose between logging in anonymously or as a
    registered user. The network share on the FreeLCS - server is configured to
    accept only anonymous logins. So don't write any username or password, just
    click "<strong>Guest</strong>".<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="" src="../Pictures/Mounting-OS_X-finnish-02.jpg"><br>
    Now the window changes and looks like the one below. Click "<strong>Connect</strong>".<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="" src="../Pictures/Mounting-OS_X-finnish-03.jpg"><br>
    The icon of the mounted server disk appears on the desktop. You can make
    mounting as easy as clicking on an icon if you create an alias to the
    server.<br>
    <br>
    Hold down <strong>alt</strong> and <strong>cmd</strong> - buttons and make
    a copy of the server disk icon by dragging it with the mouse. <br>
    <img alt="" src="../Pictures/Mounting-OS_X-finnish-04.jpg"><br>
    When you release the mouse and icon looking like the original one appears on
    the desktop, the only difference is that the new icon has a curved arrow on
    the bottom of the picture. A picture with an arrow like this is an alias and
    it is a shortcut to the server disk. Next time you can mount the server disk
    just by double clicking on the alias.<br>

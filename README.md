#Introduction To Loudness Correction
This is a presentation about loudness and loudness correction I created. The target audience is video editors and people that are not audio engineers. The presentation tries to tell the most important things about loudness management, EBU R128 and loudness correction in terms that are not too technical. The presentation also sidesteps the technical details about how R128 and ITU-R BS 1770 works, because the target audience has no use for these details, they only need to know what the loudness problem is, and how R128 tries to solve it and how loudness management changes their everyday workflows.

The presentation also talks about how to use my open source project: Free Loudness Correction Server (http://freelcs.sourceforge.net/).

The files in the presentation come in two languages (finnish, english) and in a couple formats:

    The **html** - version is the full version of the presentation. It is meant to be put up on a server for people to use as a reference when they start new workflows with loudness management. People that could not attend the presentation can be pointed to this version, and they can get everything from the presentation just by reading this version through.
    The **odp** - version consists of slides (powerpoint). This has the content of the html - version, but it is "compressed" to "one liners" or "bullet points" and the person giving the presentation is expected to explain every bullet point. The "story" of this version follows the html - version, so the person giving the presentation can use the html - version as a reference. 
    The pictures of the presentation come in **jpg**, **png** and **xcf** - formats. The xcf - version has different items of the picture on separate layers so the picture can be easily modified. Jpg and png versions do not have any layers, editing them is possible but more limited.
    The video samples are available in two formats: **mp4** (h264) and **webm**. Video samples are played using html5 native video player and most browsers support either mp4 or webm.

You are free to take this presentation, modify it and use it as the basis for your own (see how to edit these files at the bottom of this text) :)

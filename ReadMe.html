    <h1>Introduction To Loudness Correction<br>
    </h1>
    This is a presentation about loudness and loudness correction I created. The
    target audience is video editors and people that are not audio engineers.
    The presentation tries to tell the most important things about loudness
    management, EBU R128 and loudness correction in terms that are not too
    technical. The presentation also sidesteps the technical details about how
    R128 and ITU-R BS 1770 works, because the target audience has no use for
    these details, they only need to know what the loudness problem is, and how
    R128 tries to solve it and how loudness management changes their everyday
    workflows.<br>
    <br>
    The presentation also talks about how to use my open source project: Free
    Loudness Correction Server (<a href="http://freelcs.sourceforge.net/">http://freelcs.sourceforge.net/</a>).<br>
    <br>
    The files in the presentation come in two languages (finnish, english) and
    in a couple formats:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>html</strong> - version is the full version of the
        presentation. It is meant to be put up on a server for people to use as
        a reference when they start new workflows with loudness management.
        People that could not attend the presentation can be pointed to this
        version, and they can get everything from the presentation just by
        reading this version through. </li>
      <li>The <strong>odp</strong> - version consists of slides (powerpoint).
        This has the content of the html - version, but it is "compressed" to
        "one liners" or "bullet points" and the person giving the presentation
        is expected to explain every bullet point. The "story" of this version
        follows the html - version, so the person giving the presentation can
        just read the html - version aloud.</li>
      <li>The pictures of the presentation come in <strong>jpg</strong>, <strong>png</strong>
        and <strong>xcf</strong> - formats. The xcf - version has different
        items of the picture on separate layers so the picture can be easily
        modified. Jpg and png versions do not have any layers, editing them is
        possible but more limited.</li>
      <li>The video samples are available in two formats: <strong>mp4</strong>
        (h264) and <strong>webm</strong>. Video samples are played using html5
        native video player and most browsers support either mp4 or webm.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

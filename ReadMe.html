    <h1>Introduction To Loudness Correction<br>
    </h1>
    This is a presentation about loudness and loudness correction I created. The
    target audience is video editors and people that are not audio engineers.
    The presentation tries to tell the most important things about loudness
    management, EBU R128 and loudness correction in terms that are not too
    technical. The presentation also sidesteps the technical details about how
    R128 and ITU-R BS 1770 works, because the target audience has no use for
    these details, they only need to know what the loudness problem is, and how
    R128 tries to solve it and how loudness management changes their everyday
    workflows.<br>
    <br>
    The presentation also talks about how to use my open source project: Free
    Loudness Correction Server (http://freelcs.sourceforge.net/).<br>
    <br>
    The files in the presentation come in two languages (finnish, english) and
    in three formats:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The html - version is the full version of the presentation. It is
        meant to be put up on a server for people to use as a reference when
        they start new workflows with loudness management. People that could not
        attend the presentation can be pointed to this version, and they can get
        everything from the presentation just by reading this version through. </li>
      <li>The odp - version consists of slides (powerpoint). This has the
        content of the html - version, but it is "compressed" to "one liners" or
        "bullet points" and the person giving the presentation is expected to
        explain every bullet point. The "story" of this version follows the html
        - version, so the person giving the presentation can just read the html-
        version aloud.</li>
      <li>The pictures of the presentation come in jpg, png and xcf - formats.
        The xcf - version has different items of the picture on separate layers
        so the picture can be easily modified. Jpg and png versions do not have
        any layers, editing them is possible but more limited.</li>
      <li>The video samples are available in two formats: mp4 (h264) and webm.
        The content is identical in both formats.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
